*' @code
*' Initialization of peatland
*' First, all degraded peatland is assigned to cropland. However, if the degraded peatland 
*' is larger than the actual cropland multiplied by a scaling factor (see below), 
*' degraded peatland used as cropland is reduced accordingly. In each cell, 
*' we scale the actual cropland with the ratio of total peatland area and total land area 
*' (factor between 0 and 1) because we use this scaling factor for modeling future 
*' peatland dynamics based on agricultural land use (see equations). Accounting for 
*' this scaling factor in the initial distribution of degraded peatland to cropland 
*' makes sure that a full reduction of cropland would also reduce degraded peatland 
*' used as cropland to zero in a given cell, which is of particular importance 
*' for the peatland restoration scenarios. After this first step, the remaining degraded 
*' peatland (if any exists) is assigned to pasture with the same rules, i.e. 
*' assignment to pasture is constrained by the scaled actual pasture area. In a third 
*' step, all remaining degraded peatland is assigned to forestry with these rules. 
*' Finally, any remaining degraded peatland in a cell after these 3 steps is 
*' added to the degraded peatland category with equal distribution among 
*' cropland, pasture and forestry (land-use categories are important for the 
*' application of the wetland GHG emission factors). In total, we therefore have 
*' 3 peatland categories: intact, degraded and unused. And for degraded and unused
*' we know the current/previous land use: cropland, pasture and forestry.
